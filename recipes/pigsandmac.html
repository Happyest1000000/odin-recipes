        <h1>Macaroni and Cheese and Pigs in a Blanket</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            When you need to feel like a kid again, this is the best way to make it happen. Some simple boxed macaroni and cheese pairs with
            delicious crescent-roll-wrapped hot dogs, or cheese dogs if that's your preference, to make this a simple yet delightful and very homey
            meal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ready in just 20 minutes, you can find all these ingredients for about 10$ (if you don't already have them in your fridge). This is a
            great one to teach your kids to make on their own whether it's a day you are too tired to cook or they are on their own for dinner.
