        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            When you need to feel like a kid again, this is the best way to make it happen. Some simple boxed macaroni and cheese pairs with
            delicious crescent-roll-wrapped hot dogs, or cheese dogs if that's your preference, to make this a simple yet delightful and very homey
            meal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ready in just 20 minutes, you can find all these ingredients for about 10$ (if you don't already have them in your fridge). This is a
            great one to teach your kids to make on their own whether it's a day you are too tired to cook or they are on their own for dinner.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 box Kraft Macaroni and Cheese</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of milk</li>
                </ul>
                <li>1 tube (8 rolls) Pillsbury Butter Flake Crescent Rolls</li>
                <li>8 hot dogs (it was always Oscar Mayer Cheese Dogs for me, growing up)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>Lay parchment paper or use cooking spray on a sheet pan for the pigs and blankets.</li>
                <li>Remove crescent rolls and hot dogs from packages, and lay one hot dog parallel to the shortest edge of each unrolled crescent roll.</li>
                <li>Wrap each crescent roll around its hot dog, squeezing and rolling the crescent roll afterward to make an even casing for almost
                    the whole length of its hot dog.
                </li>
                <li>Evenly space the eight pigs in blankets around the prepared sheet pan. I prefer two rows of 4, each at roughly 45 degree angle.</li>
                <li>When the oven is preheated, insert the pan on the middle rack and bake them for 10-12 minutes. The tops and bottoms should begin
                    to look golden-brown.
                </li>
                <li>While the pigs in blankets bake. Prepare the macaroni and cheese per the instructions on the Kraft box. NOTE: Add the butter to
                    the pot before returning the strained macaroni - this will help the butter melt. Then, add the cheese powder, followed by the 
                    milk to help the powder incorporate into a sauce instead of clumping together. 
                </li>
                <li>Once the pigs are sufficiently baked and the macaroni and cheese is complete, divide them onto plates in desired serving sizes!</li>
            </ol>
