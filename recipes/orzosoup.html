        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Otherwise known as "Hygge in a Bowl," this Creamy White Bean Lemon Pesto Orzo Soup forms the perfect combination of healthy and flavorful.
                The ingredients are easy to come by, if you don't already have them in your pantry, and relatively inexpensive. This also fits a
                vegetarian diet - party of why it is so good for you.</p>

            <p>Although it will take a little time to learn on your first attempt, most of this recipe's preparation time is simply warming various
                ingredients in the soup pot. With so little prep time, you can easily get something else done while this cooks - checking in periodically.

                <li>red pepper flakes, to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 cups dry orzo pasta</li>
                <li>6 cups low sodium chicken or vegetable broth</li>
                <li>1 can white beans</li>
                <li>kosher salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 bunch kale, finely shredded</li>
                <li>1/2 cup basil pesto</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, garlic, and chili flakes and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. 
                    Drop in the butter, then stir in the orzo. Cook until golden, 1-3 minutes. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Season with salt and pepper. 
                    Stir in the beans and kale. Season with salt and pepper. If you have one, add a parmesan rind. Simmer 8-10 minutes until the orzo is al dente, stirring often. 
                    It should become very creamy.</li>
                <li>Stir in the pesto, milk, parmesan, and lemon, cook another few minutes until warmed through.</li>
                <li>Divide the orzo and broth among bowls and add additional parmesan and black pepper. I like to add some fresh dill, parsley, or basil too!</li>
            </ol>
